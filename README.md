# MotionData

Purpose of this gem is to provide a layer of abstraction on top of CoreData to be used with RubyMotion. It is inspired by ActiveRecord and tries to follow the ruby-way. 

This gem is intended to be used with RubyMotion. It is heavily based (read: copy-paste) of the work done by fousa for
[motion_migrate](https://github.com/fousa/motion_migrate) and [@mattgreen](https://github.com/mattgreen/) for [Nitron](https://github.com/mattgreen/nitron). Whoever I was unhappy with some decisions made in both of these projects, so I decided to spin off my own gem.

Right now the gem is in early development phase and I am not releasing it on ruby gems.
